From this assignment, I learned how to build a simple webpage using html, css, and javascript. I practiced creating and styling elements like input fields and buttons, and I learned how to use local storage to save and display the users name. One of the things I found challenging was adding a greeting based on the time of day. I know it was apart of the bonus but I still wanted to do it, and it took so long for me to figure it out. I watched some youtube videos that explained how to get the current time and set up a function that changes the greeting. It was fun to see how small changes in css could make the page more interactive and personalized. Overall, this assignment helped me understand how all three work together so well to create a page.
